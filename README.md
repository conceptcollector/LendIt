# LendIt

## Description

I built this in two weeks.

I've always strengthened my relationships with my friends by sharing creative works with them. "Dude, have you read this?? You have to! I'll bring it next time I see you, I want to know what you think." This is part of the goal of LendIt; to strengthen communities and maybe build even some new ones along the way.

## Usage

Users can register with a username and password. Once they've registered or logged in, they're taken to the home screen which displays the current inventory. Clicking on the email link will allow the users to contact the user who posted the item they're interested in to arrange a hand off.

On their profile page, users are asked to register their email address so that other users can contact them. They can add a new item by clicking the "Add Item" button. They can also edit and delete the items they've already posted. Each item is displayed on a card with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.

The add item and edit item screens are close to identical. The users can input a title, which is required. They can also add the author's name, an cover image URL, the media type, and comments, none of which are required.
